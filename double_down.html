      <p>Double Down is a band I started at Durham. My friend Bailey Vokes and I would regularly jam together and write songs. I have since performed some of these, and lots of my own material, with James Hughes and Alex Jones.</p>
      <p>Some of these songs were previously available as part of DOMAN's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3cttCWeFLIo1Oq3i2w2s51">Michaelmas Domix compilation album on Spotify</a>. Martha Lily Dean authored a <a href="https://www.palatinate.org.uk/album-review-doman-michaelmas-domix/">review of the compilation in the Palatinate</a>, including the following complimentary portion regarding our contribution.</p>
      
      <blockquote cite="https://www.palatinate.org.uk/album-review-doman-michaelmas-domix/">
        Double Down is the first group to feature, also adding three songs to the mixtape. The opening guitar riff of ‘No Dice’ is reminiscent of Nirvana’s ‘Smells Like Teen Spirit’; however, the group keep the general tone of the piece far more acoustic. The simple vocals and guitar concept in ‘Lazy Day’ particularly allows Saunders’s voice to shine through. Overall, the innovative bass lines and funky inspirations show off their range and capture the talent of this duo.

      <p>I decided recently I wasn't overly proud of the recordings so I contacted Spotify to have them removed. Since then, a few people have asked me about the recordings so I decided to just upload the files here.</p>

      <p>Free software legend Richard Stallman has a page on his website with a list of ways in which <a href="https://www.stallman.org/spotify.html">Spotify mistreats its users</a>, which is a good read if you need reasons to stop using Spotify other than "their mobile app is slow, looks naff and has TikTok-style brain-rotting short-form scrolling bolted on" and "<a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2025-07-31/spotifys-ceo-owns-an-ai-weapons-company-some-musicians-say-its-time-to-leave">their CEO is funding an AI weapons firm</a>". </p>
