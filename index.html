            I am a first year maths PhD student at the University of Sheffield. I am a member of the <a href="https://alg-top.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/">algebraic topology research group</a>. I
            am supervised by <a href="https://szymik.github.io/">Markus Szymik</a>.

            <br><br>


            I am currently learning about highly structured ring spectra, with a particular focus on obtaining a better understanding of the natural $E_\infty$ structure on the unoriented bordism spectrum.
