            My name is Jake Saunders. You can contact me via email: JSESaunders1 at sheffield dot ac dot uk.

            I am a third year maths PhD student at the University of Sheffield. I am a member of the <a href="https://alg-top.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/">algebraic topology research group</a>, and my supervisor is <a href="https://szymik.github.io/">Markus Szymik</a>.

            <br><br>

            I'm thinking about highly structured ring spectra of characteristic 2.
            In particular, I'm attempting to give a description of the $E_n$ structure on the unoriented bordism spectrum $MO$ which arises from its description as the Thom spectrum of a map $BO \to BGL_1 \mathbb{S}$ of infinite loop spaces. 
            As an application, I'd like to know whether the mod 2 Euler characteristic, which is an additive and multiplicative bordism invariant, lifts to a map of $E_n$ ring spectra $MO \to Eh$, for some $E_n$ ring spectrum $Eh$.

            There are a number of other problems that I'm interested in, but not necessarily actively working on. You can find them <a href="problems.html">here</a>.
