            My name is Jake Saunders. You can contact me via email: JSESaunders1 at sheffield dot ac dot uk.

            <br><br>

            I am a second year maths PhD student at the University of Sheffield. I am a member of the <a href="https://alg-top.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/">algebraic topology research group</a>, and my supervisor is <a href="https://szymik.github.io/">Markus Szymik</a>.

            <br><br>

            My research concerns the problem of describing the $E_\infty$ structure on the unoriented bordism spectrum $MO$.
            Hence (or otherwise), to determine whether the mod 2 Euler characteristic, which is an additive and multiplicative bordism invariant, lifts to a map of $E_\infty$ ring spectra $MO \to Eh$, for some $E_\infty$ ring spectrum $Eh$.

            <br><br>

            I plan to supervise a UGRI project this year about homological algebra. The description can be found <a href="files/ugri_24.pdf">here</a>, where it is billed as Project 1. If you're interested/have questions, please get in touch!

            <br><br>

            In 2024, <a href="https://lewismcombes.github.io/">Lewis Combes</a> and I will be running a study group where we figure out how to use Lean, and formalise a bit of maths. <a href="lean-24.html">You can find more information about this here</a>.
