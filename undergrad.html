      <h2>Undergraduate Projects</h2>

        <p>
            Here are some things I did as an undergraduate.

            <a href="https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/maths/staff/11466/dr-christopher-tedd">Christopher Tedd</a> supervised me for a summer research project on the relationship between partially-ordered sets and the prime spectra of commutative rings.
            A first stab at maths research, the resulting report can be read <a href="files/undergraduate/rep_poset_maps_by_ring_homs.pdf">here</a>. The ideas contained within are simple but <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/advice-on-writing-papers/give-appropriate-amounts-of-detail/">obscured by detail</a>.

            <br><br>

            <a href="https://maths.dur.ac.uk/users/andrew.lobb/">Andrew Lobb</a> supervised me for an LMS funded undergraduate research project on results relating to the square peg problem.
            I was able to very very slightly generalize an earlier result about $n$-rhombs inscribed in spheres embedded in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The paper can be read <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07290">here</a>. It has some nice pictures made using <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>.

            <a href="https://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/users/alexander.stasinski/">Alexander Stasinski</a> supervised me for my MMath project. It centres around <i>Gerstenhaber's theorem</i>, which states that for any field $F$ and commuting matrices $A, B \in M_n(F)$, the dimension of the (unital) algebra $F[A, B]$ is less than or equal to $n$. A similar statement for 4 commuting matrices does not hold, and the problem of whether a similar statement holds for 3 matrices is open, and actively being worked on. The problem has connections to algebraic geometry and an interesting canonical matrix form called the <i>Weyr form</i>. The final report can be read <a href="files/undergraduate/jacob_saunders_weyr_matrices.pdf">here</a>.
